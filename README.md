# sourced

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Event Sourcing / CQRS library for Ruby.
There's many ES gems available already. The objectives here are:
* Cohesive and toy-like DX.
* Eventual consistency by default.
* Built around the [Decide, Evolve, React pattern](https://ismaelcelis.com/posts/decide-evolve-react-pattern-in-ruby/)
* Control concurrency by modeling.
* Explore ES as a programming model for Ruby apps.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add sourced

**Note**: this gem is under active development, so you probably want to install from Github:
In your Gemfile:

    $ gem 'sourced', github: 'ismasan/sourced'

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Setup

Create a Postgres database.
For now Sourced uses the Sequel gem. In future there'll be an ActiveRecord adapter with migrations support.

Configure and migrate the database.

```ruby
Sourced.configure do |config|
  config.backend = Sequel.connect(ENV.fetch('DATABASE_URL'))
end

Sourced.config.backend.install unless Sourced.config.backend.installed?
```

Register your Deciders and Reactors.

```ruby
Sourced::Router.register(Leads::Decider)
Sourced::Router.register(Leads::Listings)
Sourced::Router.register(Webooks::Dispatcher)
```

Start background workers.

```ruby
#Â require your code here
Sourced::Supervisor.start(count: 10) # 10 worker fibers
```

## Concurrency

Workers process events and commands by acquiring locks on `[reactor group ID][stream ID]`.

This means that all events for a given reactor/stream are processed in order, but events for different streams can be processed concurrently. You can define workflows where some work is done concurrently by modeling them as a collaboration of streams.

## Scheduled commands


## Rails integration

Soon.

## Sourced vs. ActiveJob

ActiveJob is a great way to handle background jobs in Rails. It's simple and easy to use. However, it's not designed for event sourcing.
ActiveJob backends (and other job queues) are optimised for parallel processing of jobs, this means that multiple jobs for the same business entity may be processed in parallel without any ordering guarantees.

Sourced's concurrency model is designed to process events for the same entity in order, while allowing for parallel processing of events for different entities.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
