# sourced

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Event Sourcing / CQRS library for Ruby.
There's many ES gems available already. The objectives here are:
* Cohesive and toy-like DX.
* Eventual consistency by default.
* Built around the [Decide, Evolve, React pattern](https://ismaelcelis.com/posts/decide-evolve-react-pattern-in-ruby/)
* Control concurrency by modeling.
* Explore ES as a programming model for Ruby apps.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add sourced

**Note**: this gem is under active development, so you probably want to install from Github:
In your Gemfile:

    $ gem 'sourced', github: 'ismasan/sourced'

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Setup

Register your Deciders and Reactors.

```ruby
Sourced::Router.register(Leads::Decider)
Sourced::Router.register(Leads::Listings)
Sourced::Router.register(Webooks::Dispatcher)
```

Start background workers.

```ruby
# require your code here
Sourced::Supervisor.start(count: 10) # 10 worker fibers
```

## Concurrency

Workers process events and commands by acquiring locks on `[reactor group ID][stream ID]`.

This means that all events for a given reactor/stream are processed in order, but events for different streams can be processed concurrently. You can define workflows where some work is done concurrently by modeling them as a collaboration of streams.

## Scheduled commands


## Rails integration

Soon.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
